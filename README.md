# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Setup
- Navigate towards index.js
- Tap cmd + j or Ctrl + j to open a new terminal
- Run  'npm i' to install all the packages
- Run 'node index.js' to run a new game of Tic-Tac-Toe

## How it works?

- Once the game begins, you the player will get a choice of places on the board
- The places operate in a box format
- E.g.  A1,A2,A3
        B1,B2,B3
        C1,C2,C3
- When you want to choose a position enter one of the keys and your spot will be shown with 'X'
- Once that position has been chosen by you or the computer, it is unable to be selected anymore
- The box is displayed to showcase what other options you have left
- Enjoy!
